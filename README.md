# M.Tech_Project_MATLAB

The objective of my M.Tech Project work is to synthesize the mechanism for three and four precision points. In literature, there is no systematic procedure available analytically as well as graphically. Hence, I have developed a systematic graphical approach to synthesize four-link mechanism and estimate its path. The validation of the results obtained using graphical approach is done by comparing it with analytical technique i.e. complex number approach. To make mechanism applicable for industrial problems, prescribed timing is also considered for the input link.

This synthesis problem is non-linear but can be modeled in the form of simultaneous equations. To solve them LM algorithm and Fixed Point algorithm are used. For complete analytical treatment MATLAB program were developed. Moreover, for visualization animation of the mechanism was also developed. This thesis work as a prominent contribution to the development of a systematic graphical approach and analytical approach using gradient-based techniques.
